** early_init.el
Everything in early_init.el.
- Boot performance improvements like garbage collection settings.
- Some early UI customization for speed up opening and robust startup screen.

** def-confs.el - Default Configurations
Default emacs settings and keybings which I set no whether happends.
- Except major-mode settings like org-mode.

** fo-configs.el - Fast Open Configurations
Ido-mode like default emacs packages loading. I will not use them as a my primary configs but for fast oppen, it is good solitions.
