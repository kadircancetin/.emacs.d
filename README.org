** early_init.el
- Boot performance (ex: grabadge collection, startup ui configurations)
- Some variables defining like =kadir/emacs-fast-open fast-open= or =kadir/default-font-size=.

** def-confs.el - Default Configurations
Default Emacs settings, keybindings and function. Without any package.
- Except major-mode settings like org-mode.

** fo-configs.el - Fast Open Configurations
Ido-mode like default emacs packages loading. I will not use them as a my primary configurations but for fast oppen, it is good solutions.

** k-packaging.el - Pacage Initializing
It has package installers (=straight.el=, =use-pacakge=), very generic packaging packages (like =no-littering=).
